# MCO2-Transaction-Management
The course project on Transactions Management is a venue for students to practice building a distributed database system that supports concurrent multi-user access. Students will once again use the IMDB_ijs dataset to design a three-node distributed database system where they perform concurrent transactions and simulate crash and recovery techniques. The final output will be a software that will be demonstrated during the indicated schedule to the respective STADVDB teachers, and a test script showing the results of performing the different test cases described below on your software.
